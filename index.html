        <h2>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h2>
        <P>What about concept centaur?</P>

                    <h4>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h4>
                <p>Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole.
                    The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
                   From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs.
                    It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.
                   
                   The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a prince—a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product.
                    Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

                    <h4>WHAT IS CENTAUR?</h4>
                    <P>Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension systems, and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. 
                        Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact way to explore the world. 
                        Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and commercial applications.

                    <h4>Simultaneous mechanical and drive-by-wire steering: </h4>
                    <P>* Smart steering: The front two wheels turn left and right mechanically, which is made possible by an innovative linkage system designed by Segway engineers.
                         The Centaur's advanced controls software also allows the rear wheels to turn at different rates in response to data received from the rider's steering direction.
                          When on two wheels, steering is accomplished in the same manner, by turning the handlebar. 
                          Sensors in the vertical portion of the steering column monitor the rider's input and sends a signal to the controller boards, which then issue a command to drive either or both of the rear wheels.
                           Turning rate is coordinated so that even with the wheels off the ground, Centaur follows the path defined by the front wheel angles. This allows smooth transitions between two-wheel and four-wheel operation.
